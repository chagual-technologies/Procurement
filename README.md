# Purchase System by Chagual Tech/ Macarena Carreno

Purchase system for manage a small company. Updated for Office365 Aouth.

Looking to mix up a backend with express/sequelize and a frontend with react/redux? That's `boilermaker`!

Follow along with the workshop to make your own! This canonical version can serve as a reference, or a starting point all on its own.

## Setup

To use this boilerplate, you'll need to take the following steps:

* Don't fork or clone this repo! Instead, create a new, empty directory on your machine and `git init` (or create an empty repo on Github and clone it to your local machine)
* Run the following commands:

```
git remote add boilermaker https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/boilermaker.git
git fetch boilermaker
git merge boilermaker/master
```

Why did we do that? Because every once in a while, `boilermaker` may be updated with additional features or bug fixes, and you can easily get those changes from now on by entering:

```
git fetch boilermaker
git merge boilermaker/master
```

## Customize

Now that you've got the code, follow these steps to get acclimated:

* Update project name and description in `package.json` and `.travis.yml` files
* `npm install`, or `yarn install` - whatever you're into
* Create two postgres databases: `boilermaker` and `boilermaker-test` (you can substitute these with the name of your own application - just be sure to go through and change the `package.json` and `.travis.yml` to refer to the new name)

#NOTES by MC

* Create two MySql databases: `compras` and `compras-test`

---

* By default, running `npm test` will use `boilermaker-test`, while regular development uses `boilermaker`
* Create a file called `secrets.js` in the project root

  * This file is `.gitignore`'d, and will _only_ be required in your _development_ environment
  * Its purpose is to attach the secret env variables that you'll use while developing
  * However, it's **very** important that you **not** push it to Github! Otherwise, _prying eyes_ will find your secret API keys!
  * It might look like this:

  ```
    process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = 'hush hush'
    process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = 'pretty secret'
    process.env.GOOGLE_CALLBACK = '/auth/google/callback'
  ```

* To use OAuth with Google, complete the step above with a real client ID and client secret from Google
  * You can get them here: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials
* Finally, complete the section below to set up your linter

## Linting

Linters are fundamental to any project - they ensure that your code has a consistent style, which is critical to writing readable code.

Boilermaker comes with a working linter (ESLint, with `eslint-config-fullstack`) "out of the box." However, everyone has their own style, so we recommend that you and your team work out yours and stick to it. Any linter rule that you object to can be "turned off" in `.eslintrc.json`. You may also choose an entirely different config if you don't like ours:

* [Standard style guide](https://standardjs.com/)
* [Airbnb style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
* [Google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)

## Start

`npm run start-dev`
`npm run seed`
